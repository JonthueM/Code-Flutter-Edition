# Code365-Flutter-Edition
Daily Code Challenge for Flutter &amp; Dart. This challenge will not end until I land a job in the field.

##Apologies
I started off too strong and try to push myself beyond then what I could learn and do in the time I had so I find myself getting quickly depressed, but  I reminded myself that I am doing this to get a job and make it in this crazy world, so if I have to revise and slow down then I will.

## Jun 12 Changes - Projects instead of Dates
I will make it project oriented instead of dates. Reason being is because the stress is real and I simply don't have the time to finish things in that small window of a day. So the aim is to make commits a day rather then finish a project in a day.
